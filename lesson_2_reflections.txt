What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

When I initialize a repository, Git starts tracking the changes I make according to saved commits.
This helps keep version control

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

The staging area is an intermediary area that preps files for version control tracking.
It offers the user control of exactly what files need to be commited at any given time.
